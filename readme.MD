# WorldCube Website Project

This is a coursework project that is made in PHP. It is a mock store front that sells items.

The original purpose or state of the website is supposed to be run on a domain along side 3 other domains. The /main/ webpage is meant to act like a main marketplace linking to the other 3 storefronts.

The project uses PHP for everything including making Mysql calls, functions for interactive buttons and more. Mysql is used to store users, products, and reviews data.
